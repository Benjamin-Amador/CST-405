To be able to run the parser you will need to have bison installed onto your version of linux
Make parser will generate the parser using the parser.y file
The parser will take the tokens generated by the lexer being run on program.gcupl
When the parser is run it will output into the console.
If the user wants to edit the program.gcupl, lex.l, or the parser they can do so using any text editor.
