To be able to run the lexer you will need to have flex installed onto your version of linux
To use the Makefile included make sure that make is installed on linux
The Makefile has two commands that can be used. They are make lexer and make clean.
Make lexer will generate the lexer using the lex.l file and the input file program.gcupl
Make clean will delete all the files except the table.txt generated by make lexer.
When the lexer is run it will output into the console as well as create a text file in the same directory that has the output.
If the user wants to edit the program.gcupl, lex.l, or the Makefile they can do so using any text editor.
